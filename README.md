# General objective
Developing an application with RESTful backend that accesses stored data in a relational database based on a persistance API and data exposed by an external service and SPA frontend in React made with a framework based on components.
# Description
This is an application for web technologies discipline exam that has a backend developed with NodeJS and frontend with React based on two entities (VirtualShelf and Book) with one-to-many relationship between them.
Operations that are implemented for these entities (both on backend and frontend) are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and also filtering, sorting and pagination.
Besides, data can be imported/exported from/in a JSON file.
Initial, the database used was SQLite, but for deploying the application on Heroku it has been replaced with PostgreSQL.<br>
The application is available here: https://ana-iordache-examen-webtech.herokuapp.com/.
